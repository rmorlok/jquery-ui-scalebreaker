# jquery-ui-scalebreaker

- An ultra-lightweight modal dialog that repositions itself on the screen to the visible viewport and scales back to device-width element size while user is browser zooming into the page. It **stays the same size and in the same position as if the zoom wasn't happening**. Features a click-to-close backdrop of pure industry standard. Needs more love.
- Uses native CSS3 keyframe animations for it's hide/show routine. Scrollable with IScroll 5 lite.
- Built upon the jQuery UI widget factory, minimal design easily customizable in CSS.
