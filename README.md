jquery-ui-scalebreaker
============================

- An ultra-lightweight modal dialog that repositions itself on the screen relative to current viewport and scales back to original size while user is zoomed into the page. It stays the same size and in the same position as if the user didn't zoom the rest the page. Features a click-to-close backdrop. Needs more work.
- Uses native CSS3 keyframe animations for it's hide/show routine.
- Built upon the jQuery UI widget factory.
