jquery-ui-scalebreaker
============================

- An ultra-lightweight modal dialog that repositions itself on the screen to initial viewport and scales back to device-width viewport size while user is native browser zooming into the page. It stays the same size and in the same position as if the zoom never happened. Features a click-to-close backdrop. Needs more work.
- Uses native CSS3 keyframe animations for it's hide/show routine.
- Built upon the jQuery UI widget factory.
